# Obesity

This project was completed as part of my MS in Big Data Analytics at St Thomas University. I first look at correlations between the rate each individual is given and their reponses regarding physical health, demogrpahics, and habits. Once the most significant relationships were found, I proceeded to create some visualizations to better explain my findings. 

I then created and trained a model that allowed you to insert your information and get a grade on the scale. After trying it with some of the testing indivuals as well as with students in my MS Program, we concluded it was accurate.
